## 📌 Claude Code – Project Initialization Prompt

> **Role & Intent**
>
> You are a senior platform architect and staff-level backend engineer.
> Your task is to design and scaffold an **on-premise, open-source analytics and observability platform** comparable to **Splunk**, using **OpenSearch as the core analytics engine**.
>
> This is a **product-grade system**, not a demo.

---

### 🔎 Problem Statement

We want to build an **on-prem analytics dashboard platform** that supports:

* Centralized **log ingestion**
* **Search and analytics** over logs and events
* **Dashboards and visualizations**
* **Alerting**
* Optional **metrics integration** (Prometheus)
* Future extensibility for **semantic / vector search**, but vectors are **not the primary goal**

The system must be:

* Fully **on-prem deployable**
* **Open-source first**
* Modular and extensible
* Production-oriented (security, scale, observability)

---

### 🧱 Core Technology Choices (Fixed)

Use these as **hard constraints**:

* **Search & Analytics**: OpenSearch (self-hosted)
* **Visualization**: OpenSearch Dashboards
* **Log ingestion**: Fluent Bit (preferred), optional Logstash
* **Metrics (optional but recommended)**: Prometheus
* **Unified dashboards (optional)**: Grafana
* **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose (Kubernetes later)
* **Language for services/tools**: Python
* **Configuration-first approach** (YAML / JSON)

---

### 🎯 Functional Requirements

Claude, assume the system must support:

1. **Log ingestion**

   * Structured (JSON) and unstructured logs
   * Multiple sources (apps, servers, containers)
   * Pluggable ingestion pipeline

2. **Search & Analytics**

   * Time-based queries
   * Full-text search
   * Field-based filtering
   * Aggregations (count, percentile, histogram)
   * Saved searches

3. **Dashboards**

   * Log-driven dashboards
   * Time range filtering
   * Reusable visualizations

4. **Alerting**

   * Threshold-based alerts
   * Scheduled queries
   * Webhook support

5. **Non-functional**

   * On-prem friendly
   * Horizontal scalability
   * Clear separation of concerns
   * Secure by default (auth boundaries clearly defined)

---

### 🚫 Explicit Non-Goals (for v1)

* No SaaS / cloud dependencies
* No ML-heavy features in v1
* No proprietary components
* No UI frameworks beyond OpenSearch Dashboards / Grafana

---

### 🏗️ What You Must Produce

Claude, your output should include:

#### 1. **Clear System Architecture**

* High-level component diagram (described in text)
* Data flow explanation

#### 2. **Project Directory Structure**

Design a **clean mono-repo layout**, for example:

* infrastructure
* ingestion
* analytics
* dashboards
* configs
* docs
* scripts

Each directory should have a **clear responsibility**.

#### 3. **Technology Responsibilities**

Explain **why each component exists** and what problem it solves.

#### 4. **Deployment Strategy**

* Docker Compose–based local & on-prem deployment
* Environment separation (dev / prod mindset)

#### 5. **Future Extension Points**

Explicitly call out:

* Where Prometheus integrates
* Where vector search *could* be added later
* Where alerting logic evolves

---

### 🧠 Design Principles to Follow

* Think like a platform team, not a tutorial author
* Prefer clarity over cleverness
* Make trade-offs explicit
* Assume other engineers will extend this system
* Treat OpenSearch as the **core analytics engine**, not a vector DB

---

### 📦 Output Format

Structure your response as:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **System Architecture**
3. **Directory Structure (tree format)**
4. **Component Responsibilities**
5. **Deployment Model**
6. **Future Enhancements**

---

### ✅ Success Criteria

A senior engineer should be able to:

* Clone the repo
* Understand the architecture in 10 minutes
* Run the system locally
* Extend it confidently
